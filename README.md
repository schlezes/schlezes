Hello,

I am Vince Schlezes.

A vanilla JavaScript developer.

  * I have about 4000 lines of vanilla JavaScript code on the internet with schlezes.com and schlezes.tech.

I am Living in the Los Angeles Area and am active with LA City Tax Certificate.

During 2021, I was recruited for a position that required a clearance, and I was adjudicated for interim Secret Clearance;

therefore,

I deleted all of my visible presence on the web with schlezes.com, schlezes.tech, Indeed and GitHub repositories to disappear from the public domain.

Now, in the beginning of April 2022, I am starting to rebuild my new presence in the public domain with web pages, Indeed and GitHub repositories.

And, am ready to re-open for business with on site coding.

My special interest is with Vue as I evolve from imperative to declarative rendering discipline with Vue.

At this juncture, I have about 4 months of Vue CLI for the front-end, and I am preparing a Vue CLI slide set for Vue meetup in Los Angles.

Thanks.
