I am Vince Schlezes.

Up until 2023, I was committed to vanilla JavaScript as a developer.

I produced about 4000 lines of vanilla JavaScript code on the internet with schlezes.com, schlezes.tech and schlezes profile plus several presentation projects that I prepared for the JavaScript Meetup Groups.
However; in stepping back,

During 2021, I was recruited for a position that required a clearance.

That changed everything as suddenly I was confronted with several new disciplines that must be achieved before continuation as into service with the US Government.

The most important of everything was my attention to Cyber Security.

In the middle of July 2023 it became clear that I had switch all of my attention to the study of Cyber Security and Security Plus as a minimum qualification for further advancement as a software engineer.

Part of that was to remove myself from a visible presence on the web with schlezes.com, schlezes.tech, and schlezes profile

I stopped using Indeed, and I removed GitHub repositories to disappear from the public domain.

To me, Cyber Security was like 4 years of Computer Science all jammed into one test and; in my opinion, a 6 weeks study was not going to be sufficient to succeed.

For me, to perform with that discipline that meant a commitment to the deep dive study into the world of Cyber Security disciplines and that required some additional time to re-calibraite and reposition myself with the additional skill sets in Cyber Security in parallel with my 10 years of coding experience.

Thanks,

Vince Schlezes
