Hello,

I am Vince Schlezes.

A vanilla JavaScript developer.

Living in the Los Angeles Area.

With my active LA City Tax Certificate.

Decided to delete my previous repositories in favor of clearance obligations.

Now, starting to rebuild new repositories as of August 2021.

And, ready to re-open for business with on site coding.
